Use the Task tool to invoke the test-quality-guardian agent for comprehensive test creation and analysis.

The test-quality-guardian agent specializes in:
- Creating production-grade test suites with comprehensive coverage
- Testing edge cases, boundary conditions, and error scenarios
- Thread safety and concurrency testing
- Bug prevention patterns
- Technology-specific best practices for Java/Spring Boot and Python/FastAPI

When invoked, analyze the code in question and create thorough tests that cover:
1. Happy path scenarios
2. Edge cases and boundary conditions
3. Thread safety for concurrent code
4. Resource cleanup and error handling
5. Integration points and dependency failures
6. Database transaction scenarios
7. AI/ML component edge cases (CLIP, FAISS)

Apply all best practices from the test-quality-guardian agent definition for this codebase.
